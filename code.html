<h1> <u>“I’d rather lose myself in passion than lose my passion”-Jacques Mayol</u></h1>

<p> My name is Shiva Raj Adhikari. I am from Nepal and I came to the united states of America in 2016. I attended the university of the Southern Mississippi and earned an undergraduate degree in Biochemistry on May 2020.

<p> My career goal is to work on drug delivery of neurodenegeration diseases by studying the structural orientation and characterization involved in amyloid beta oligomers.

<h2><u>My Past Research and Interest</u></h2>
<p> During my undergraduate career I worked on mutliple research topics. I started as an undergrad research assistant in Dr. Bates' Lab where I investigated the effects of PII mutant on total oil content of Arabidopsis when crossed with CL37. To study this interaction, I grew genetically modified plant lines and analyzed the fatty acid & total oil content by using hexane-liquid phase separation and Gas chromatography-FID techniques. Following that, I got an opportunity in UMMC, Jackson to work as a summer student in Dr. Raucher’s Lab. Raucher group was focused on drug delivery research of cancer cells. It was a challenging task to completely switch from plant biochemistry to cell and molecular biology and get adapted in the new research environment.
Through the summer, I studied drug delivery of Doxorubicin bounded with elastin-like polypeptides used in Invitro treatment of Glioblastoma. I gained valuable experiences in cell culture, recombinant protein expression and purification, fluorescence flow cytometry (cytotoxicity), cellular uptake, and confocal microscopy for cellular localization. After a successful summer research span in Raucher’s lab and my newfound research inspirations, I became really interested in research works of Dr. Rangachari’s biophysical lab and I got an opportunity to join the lab and work under graduate student in granulin protein project. As I spent more time in the lab, I developed an interest in chemistry and kinetics of Neurodegeneration. Over last summer, I was supported by NSF-REU fund to work in Amyloid beta & Decapeptide project. Furthermore, I studied the interaction between TDP-43 and granulin7 while being at Dr. Rangachari's lab.

	After working in molecular level pathogenesis of Neurodegeneration, I believe I am ready to explore the translation research between the core of pathogenesis and drug designing. Indeed, experts in this field of neuroscience are doing exceptional work in both molecular level pathogenesis and effective drug delivery system yet there is a lot to explore in between. As, I eventually want to do research in effective drug designing of neurodegenerative diseases, I believe my graduate school education will help to gain training on understanding the bridge between cellular pathogenesis and mechanism of these infections. With the experiences gained from PhD education, I should have a solid foundation to do some novel research by implementing a unique approach in drug designing of theses diseases.
